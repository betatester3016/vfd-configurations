#display_type:
# * In [] brackets are the bit index from 0 to 7. You can use the 'Programmer' mode in Calculator to generate the hexadecimal value you need for the following fields.
# {0} - Columns = ([0:2] + 1) * 16. Rows = ([3:5] + 1) * 8. Shift display = [6:7] * 2.
# Examples: For a 128x32 display, the value should be 0x1F.
#           For a 128x64 display, the value should be 0x3F.
#           For a SH1106 128x64 display, the value should be 0x7F.
# {1} - SPI - Set to 0x80.
# {2} - Flags. [0] - Reserved. [1] - invert display. [2] - rotate display by 90 degrees. [3] - rotate display by 180 degrees (adds or [2]). [4] - Ext_Vcc - leave at 0. [5] - Alternative COM configuration, set to 1 if display is scrambled.
# Examples: To flip the display upside down, the value should be 0x08. To rotate 90 degrees - 0x04, to rotate 270 degrees - 0x0C.
#           To invert the pixels of the display, the value should be 0x02.
# {3} - Controller. 0xFD for SSD1306, 0xFC for SH1106, 0xFB for PCD8544.
